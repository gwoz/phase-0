# --- REFLECTION -------------------------------------------------------
# Write your reflection below as a comment.

# Which error was the most difficult to read?
# Ans: I found the unexpected end-of-input to be most difficult to read. This issue was identified as being at the end of the file even though the code was at the top of the file.

# How did you figure out what the issue with the error was?
# Ans: I looked at the next line of code that should have executed even though the error was at the bottom of the page. I started from the inside of the method and worked out to make sure all of the syntax was correct.

# Were you able to determine why each error message happened based on the code? 
# Ans: Yes, I've had experience with this kind of troubleshooting before and actually kind of enjoy it. It becomes a puzzle that requires you to understand what the program wants and what it's actually receiving.

# When you encounter errors in your future code, what process will you follow to help you debug?
# Ans: I will skip straight to the line of the error and look for phrases, words, or characters included in the error message. For example, I would look for variable names, method names, or other items I recently changed as a starting point.
