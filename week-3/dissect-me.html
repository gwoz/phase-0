        <h3>Version Control:Why You Need It Before The Sun Comes Up!</h3>
        <h3>1/4/2016</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Jack L. Hamilton and today I'll be blogging a little about the importance of version control.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was a young sophomore in high school, I pulled an all-nighter writing, editing and finalizing a journalism assignment for my high school newspaper. By the time the sun came up that early morning, I was a zombie and in my half-asleep state somehow
          managed to accidentally overwrite my file. To my horror, all the night's work was lost. And this wasn't even a case of not saving my work. I <i>DID</i> save my work. But there was no safety net to allow me to recover my work from just
          a few minutes before I overwrote my file. If only I could go back in time just 30 minutes!
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was much older I was updating a peace of code with two new features. I got one feature working perfectly. Feeling a sense of "flow", I felt I was unstoppable and continued to code the second feature request without making a backup of the working
          code that had the first feature all done. Hours later I realized that the new (second) feature was not working correctly as I'd hoped, and I wasn't going to have the second feature debugged any time soon. Meanwhile my employer wanted at least
          the first feature (that was ready just hours ago!) to go off to be tested in the User Acceptance Test--feature #2 could wait. Unfortunately feature #2 broke all of the code, making feature #1 unuseable until I got feature #2 either removed or
          debugged completely. If only I had not been so eager and had made a backup <b>RIGHT AFTER</b> feature #1 was completed.

        <h3>1.2 The Command Line
</h3>
        <p>
          Shell/Bash - A shell is a processor that allows you to give commands to a computer. Bash is a version of a shell and was originally used on the the GNU operating system, but it's now available on other operating systems.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
Ans: We used <section> and <article> along with <h3>, <h2>, and <p>. When we learned that blog posts would be added as the content for our page, we thought it made sense to use the <section> element since it would be grouping together common items. For each blog post we used <article> because each of these posts could stand alone as their own page. If we added more content we would use <section> again. We would also use <nav>, <header>, <footer>, and <aside> instead of the traditional approach of using <div>. This will make our page more semantic and leead to more simple CSS styling options later on.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements? 
Ans: By default, inline elements are laid out one after another and block elements are laid out on a new line. The browser goes through the html from top to bottom and outside elements working to the nested inside elements. This part still confuses me a bit, but I'm excited to learn more on this.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
Ans: I learned about the snippets feature and inserting comments to a page using Command + / in this GPS. I will definitely be creating my own snippets. It would be great to have a snippet that will initialize all of the files necessary to create a new webpage so you can go from idea to concept very quickly. I'm not going to go too far with snippets yet because I have a feeling there will be a better way to repeat blocks of code with something like Ruby. I also learned about Sublime plugins such as packagecontrol.io. These let you run a sequence of events from Sublime that access programs both inside and outside of Sublime. For example, you can open an HTML page in a browser of your choice while working on a file in Sublime.
