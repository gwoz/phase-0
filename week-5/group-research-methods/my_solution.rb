# # Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I implemented "my_array_finding_method". It uses the "grep" built-in to search
# through all the elements of an array for a given character. In the end, it returns
# a new array of all the elements of the original array that had an occurance of the given character. 
#
# To use, for the first argument, you pass in an array comprised of a word or number for each element.
# The second argument is a character you want to match in any of the elements of the array passed as argument 1.
#

# I also implemented "my_hash_finding_method". It first uses the find_all method to
# create a new array of hashes whose value equals the method's second integer argument.
# This array of hashes is passed to map to iterate over and return just the list of keys.
# 
# To use, for the first argument, you pass in a hash whose keys have integer values. The second
# argument is an integer. All keys whose values match that second argument will be returned as a 
# new array.

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
=begin
  The first method I used was .map which essentially does the same thing as .each. The only difference
  is that the array will be permanently changed if you use the bang! at the end. I also used '.is_a? Integer?'
  I found this helpful to target any number in the array instead of manually accessing the index with a number.
  For the sescond method I used .select! which returns a new object filled with the original items
  where the block you gave it returned true.

=begin
You can use map and select using brackets or the do block like so:
  array.map! { |x| x.doSomething}
  array.map! do |x|
    do something
  end
  hash.select! { |x| x.doSomething}
  hash.select! do |x|
    do something
  end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# to_s: changes the object to Object type:String.

# include?(obj) → true or false
# looks inside an Array and returns true if the given object is found inside the Array
# Array#reject! {|item| block } → ary or nil
# Array#reject! iterates though an Array and rejects/deletes any element that
# computes to true inside the block. The bang(!) at the end of reject makes the
# method directly change the given Array instead of returning a new Array
# Hash#reject! {| key, value | block } → a_hash
# rHash#reject! iterates through a Hash and deletes any element 
# that computes to true inside the block. Reject is the same as delete_if except it 
# works on and returns the Hash.

# How to use the methods
# my_array = [1,2,3,4]
# my_array[0].to_s => "1"
# my_array.reject! { |el| el == 1}  => [2,3,4]

# my_hash = {"billy" => "bob", "mickey" => "rooney"}
# my_hash.reject! {  |key, value| key == "mickey"} => {"billy" => "bob"}

=begin
.map -> This creates a new array of values after each element is evaluated by the following code block
.to_a -> Once I had an array of values that met the criteria, I put all of them inside another array for grouping
purposes. One group was integers and the other was the remaining characters.
.compact -> This eliminates any nil values from an array. My approach resulted in nil values when false which cluttered 
the ending array with unnecessary indexes.
.select -> This creates a new array of values after each element is evaluated by the following code block. This was
useful to only keep the key/value pairs that met a certain criteria.
