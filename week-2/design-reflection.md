* What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
* Ans: Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing & Delivery, and Maintenance

* What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
* Ans: The primary goal is to generate leads from potential customers. It will feature an about me, actual examples of past projects, services offered, a blog, and a contact form.

* What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
* Ans: My target audience is interested to see if my services apply to them and, if so, how I can help them based on my previous experience. The site will give users content of various lengths to match the time they have when they visit my site. For example, Projects will be short with imagery/illustrations and limited text, the Blog will be medium length and include some humor, and Services will be longer with more detail and pricing for people who are interested in working with me.

* What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
* Ans: The primary action is to submit an inquiry which will generate a lead for me to follow up on. The most direct workflow will be for people who are referred to me and just want to submit an inquiry quickly. A more indirect workflow will be for someone who may not know me, but wants to passively learn more about me from my site or the content I produce before submiting an inquiry.

* What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
* Ans: You should know that design is not exclusive to designers. Ideally everyone involved in creating a product or service should take ownership in the overall user experience.

* What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
* Ans: User experience is how someone feels when using a product or software application. User experience design is the process of studying workflows of users and optimizing for great user experiences using techniques like surveys, wireframing, and AB testing. It's valuable because we are presented with an ever increasing number of options for everything we do with limited costs of switching. Focusing on user experience can make your product or service stand out.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
* Ans: I found the creating the inline image link to be tedious. I struggled with finding the correct path to use.
