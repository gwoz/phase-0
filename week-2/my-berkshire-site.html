<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
- Ans: It was great to see how a site was actually created with the concepts we learned.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
- Ans: I was interested to see how HTML has evolved. Now when I look at a site it's easy to see which ones are using modern techniques vs legacy techniques.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)?
- Ans: This was a relief for me. It highlights a major reason why I decided to pursue DBC. I feel like I know what CAN be done, but now I'm learning what SHOULD be done.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
- Ans: The good part is that you can build a site very easily and the tags are not very complex. The bad part is that the work can be repetitive. I'm hoping we will learn how to make it less manual soon! :)
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
- Ans: It's easy for me to get lost when the code starts building up. I always try to keep the skeleton of a basic HTML page in mind as I go. This helps me remember what I'm actually trying to do when I am working on the detail of a page.
