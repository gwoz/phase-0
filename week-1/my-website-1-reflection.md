* Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
  * Ans: https://gwoz.github.io/
* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  * Ans: Configure the remote location where the files will be saved by creating a repository on GitHub. Copy the repository URL, which will be the location of the files, and then use the "git clone" command in your terminal to link your computer to this remote location. Going forward you can create or update files on your local computer and then decide when you want to send them to the GitHub remote location.
* Describe what open source means.
  * Ans: Open source means what you create is available to use, modify, or distribute, with minimal limitations.
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  * Ans: I think open source is one of the most important concepts that mankind has ever embraced. It's a bit scary because you are trusting that creators are not malicious and the general community is vigilant. But then again, many times you can't know the intent of a well known software company either. It feels like trying to sail across the ocean in a row boat right now!
* Assess the importance of using licenses.
  * Licenses are important to control how something you create is used by the community.
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  * Git and Github process was solidified for me. I've used it previously, but never really understood what I was doing. I struggle most with remembering the git commands.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  * The GitHub Guides are very good, especially the one on flow and mastering markdown
